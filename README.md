# AB Dialogs V2
Thanks for visiting the "AB Dialogs V2" repository.

When Microsoft introduced new "UCI" interface and migrated all the apps to it from the "Classic" interface - one of widely used features called "Dialogs" did not make it and was marked as [deprecated](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/important-changes-coming#process-dialogs-are-deprecated).

The goal of this project is to fill this gap and provide customizers/developers a nocode/lowcode option to create own dialogs.
